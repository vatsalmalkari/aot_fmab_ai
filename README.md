Hi everyone this is a Anime QA with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

You can ask any question about the anime attack on titan or fullmetal alchemist brotherhood.

There are three main options: trivia, summary, or fanfiction.

Use trivia to get answers to quick questions about either anime.

Summary for an episode, character summary or the plot summary.

Fanfiction to make any fictional story up.

# What this project does.
This project is a question-answering system for anime fans. 

It uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach to provide accurate, context-aware answers from anime content — like character bios, episode summaries, and trivia.

Instead of relying on AI to make things up, it first retrieves relevant facts from your own dataset, then uses Google Gemini to generate helpful responses.

# Some features
Semantic Search — Finds the most relevant content using embeddings.

Generative Answers — Uses Gemini to give rich, natural language replies.

Supports Multiple Modes — Answer trivia, give summaries, or write fan fiction.

Custom Metadata Filtering — Search by anime, type (character/episode), and more.

Fuzzy Matching — Smart matching even if you mistype names or titles.
