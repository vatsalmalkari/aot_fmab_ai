Hi everyone this is a Anime QA with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

You can ask any question about the anime attack on titan or fullmetal alchemist brotherhood.

There are three main options: trivia, summary, or fanfiction.

Use trivia to get answers to quick questions about either anime.

Summary for an episode, character summary or the plot summary.

Fanfiction to make any fictional story up.

# What this project does.
This project is a question-answering system for anime fans. 

It uses a RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) approach to provide accurate, context-aware answers from anime content — like character bios, episode summaries, and trivia.

Instead of relying on AI to make things up, it first retrieves relevant facts from a trained dataset, then uses Google Gemini to generate helpful responses.

# Some features
Semantic Search — Finds the most relevant content using embeddings.

Generative Answers — Uses Gemini to give rich, natural language replies.

Supports Multiple Modes — Answer trivia, give summaries, or write fan fiction.

Custom Metadata Filtering — Search by anime, type (character/episode), and more.

Fuzzy Matching — Smart matching even if you mistype names or titles.
