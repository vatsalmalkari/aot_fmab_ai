Edward, Alphonse, and Winry arrive in Rush Valley where Edward's state alchemist pocket watch is stolen by a pickpocket named Paninya. 
After chasing her down, they find she has automail legs. 
Winry asks the automail's creator, Dominic LeCoulte, to let her be his apprentice, but her request is swiftly denied. 
Winry convinces Paninya to stop being a pickpocket and return the pocket watch, but first she peeks inside and sees the date when the Elric brothers burned down their house. 
Meanwhile, Dominic's daughter-in-law is having a baby, and she is unable to travel to a hospital in the poor weather. 
Winry and Paninya deliver the baby, resulting in a successful birth.
Winry asks Dominic again to be an apprentice, and this time he directs her to another automail mechanical engineer. 
With that, Edward and Alphonse continue onward to Dublith.
