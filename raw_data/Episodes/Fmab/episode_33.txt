Kimblee deduces that Scar is headed north. 
He manages to catch up to the train Scar is riding, only to find his hooded companion is Yoki and not Marcoh. 
Scar and Kimblee recognize each other from their encounter in Ishval, and a fight ensues. 
Scar impales Kimblee who manages to separate the train carriages and escape. 
Meanwhile, May continues north with Marcoh, while Edward and Alphonse arrive at the mountain path leading to Briggs Fortress. 
They are attacked by Captain Buccaneer before being surrounded and captured by the guards and taken before Olivier. 
Meanwhile, May and Marcoh manage to find research notes written by Scar's brother and begin to decipher them.
