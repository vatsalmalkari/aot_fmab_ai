In a flashback to the Ishval war, Hawkeye asks Mustang to burn her father's notes on Flame Alchemy from her back. 
In the present, Hawkeye sees through Envy's disguise as Mustang and Hawkeye shoots Envy until Mustang arrives and mercilessly incinerates the homunculus, reverting him back to his parasitic form. 
Before Mustang can kill Envy, Edward, Hawkeye and Scar persuade him to stop his anger and need for revenge, with Edward arguing that Amestris cannot be ruled by someone consumed with hatred. 
Envy becomes outraged by Mustang's change of heart and tries to goad them into killing each other by pointing out all of the terrible things they have done to each other. 
Edward concludes that Envy hates humans because he is jealous of their capacity to continue living despite all the abuse they take. 
Humiliated and insulted by Edward's analysis, Envy commits suicide by tearing out and destroying his own philosopher's stone. 
Meanwhile, the Armstrong siblings slowly gain the upper hand in their battle against Sloth. 
Izumi allied with the Briggs Fortress soldiers arrives in Central to participate in the coup d'Ã©tat. 
Meanwhile below Central, Hohenheim confronts Father alone.
