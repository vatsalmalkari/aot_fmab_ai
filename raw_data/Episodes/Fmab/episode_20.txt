After arguing with his father, Edward overhears Hohenheim tell Winry's grandmother, Pinako Rockbell that the corpse that Elric brothers had attempted to transmute may not have been their mother. 
Hohenheim leaves the next day, warning Pinako that something terrible will happen in Amestris. 
Edward and Pinako dig up the failed transmutation corpse during a downpour and Edward realizes it is not their mother. 
Edward then calls Izumi, asking her to confirm that the child in her transmutation was definitely not hers. 
Edward returns to Central and reunites with Alphonse and Winry, explaining his discoveries. 
Izumi calls Edward, to say the transmuted baby was not hers. 
Edward, Alphonse, and Izumi then feel a sense of relief that they had not killed their loved ones a second time. 
This confirms Edward's suspicions that it is not possible to revive someone who has died. 
However, Edward reassures the others that retrieving someone from beyond the gateway of Truth is still possible and the Elric brothers reaffirm their resolve to return Alphonse to his original body.
