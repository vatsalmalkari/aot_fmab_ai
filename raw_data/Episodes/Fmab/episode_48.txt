Ling and Lan Fan fight Gluttony, while Heinkel continues to fight Pride. 
Meanwhile, Mustang visits Madame Christmas at her hostess bar, informing her that Selim is a homunculus. 
Pride manages to overwhelm Heinkel. 
However, before Pride can finish him off, Edward intervenes and saves Heinkel using his automail which is now reinforced with carbon. 
Spies from Central follow Mustang to the bar, then receive news that Madame Christmas is his foster mother. 
The bar suddenly explodes, and Mustang escapes into the sewers with Madame Christmas and they part ways. 
He then meets up with Hawkeye, Breda, and Fuery and confirms his plan to take over Central. 
Pride takes over Alphonse’s armor again and prepares to fight Edward, but Fu throws a flash bomb into the air overwhelming the shadows with light and breaking Pride's control. 
Darius then takes Alphonse to safety, while Gluttony stumbles into the fight between Edward and Pride. 
Upon discovering that Ling and Lan Fan can sense homunculi, Pride consumes Gluttony, both to replenish his life as well as to gain a sense of smell that can detect Edward's group, and even Hohenheim who is nearby. 
Back in Central, Mustang makes the first move in his plot by capturing Bradley’s wife.
