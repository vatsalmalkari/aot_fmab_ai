When faced with the option of judging the man who killed her parents, Winry decides to bandage Scar's wounds, knowing it would be something her parents would do. 
General Miles from Briggs, who is an Ishvalan, then explains to Scar that he joined the military to gradually change the way people think of Ishvalans and agrees to help Edward. 
Since May and Marcoh need Scar to decipher his brother's research, Miles offers to hide everyone at the fort, with Alphonse insisting on sparing the two chimeras. 
Winry comes up with a ruse to make it look like Scar has kidnapped her to elude Kimblee. 
Scar and company head for the fort via tunnels in the mine, just before a blizzard sets in. 
Miles then receives word that Olivier is no longer commander of Briggs as it is now being controlled by state alchemists. 
Alphonse willingly goes into the blizzard to find and warn the group and briefly sees his body, and wonders if it is trying to retrieve its soul. 
Meanwhile, Father makes alchemic plans involving Alphonse, Edward, Hohenheim, Izumi, and seeks one more candidate.
