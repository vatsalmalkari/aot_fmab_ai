Kain Fuery manages to save Hawkeye, with Mustang coming to defeat the homunculus named Gluttony. 
Alphonse meets up with the group and they pursue Barry, who chases his body into the depths of the third laboratory. 
The group splits into two teams. 
Mustang and Havoc are ambushed by homunculus named Lust, resulting in both men being grievously wounded and left for dead. 
Lust then confronts Barry, slicing him to pieces. 
Hawkeye, believing Mustang to be dead, desperately shoots Lust repeatedly with minimal effect. 
Before Lust can kill Hawkeye, Mustang appears, having cauterized his wounds, he repeatedly incinerates Lust until her philosopher's stone is depleted. 
No longer able to regenerate, she crumbles to ash. 
Barry's soul survives, but his blood seal is scratched out by his human body, which kills both of them. 
Edward returns to Resembool and heads toward the Rockbell residence where he sees his father Van Hohenheim at the grave of his mother Trisha Elric.
