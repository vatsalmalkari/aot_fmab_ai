Ling tries to escape with the wounded Lan Fan, but is attacked by Bradley and Gluttony. 
Meanwhile, Winry heads to where the Elric brothers are fighting Scar and she hears Edward questioning Scar about the death of her parents. 
Shocked by this, Winry picks up a nearby gun and aims it at Scar. 
It is then that Scar recounts back on his brother who had researched alchemy to combat the attacking state alchemists. 
However, they were attacked by Solf J. Kimblee, the "Crimson Alchemist" and Scar had his right arm brutally severed. 
To save him, his brother sacrificed himself and transferred his right arm onto Scar. 
Shocked upon waking up and seeing his brother's arm on his body, Scar went berserk and killed Winry's parents whom he saw as the enemy. 
Back in the present, Edward intervenes between Winry and Scar, reminding Scar of when his brother protected him. 
Edward then consoles the traumatized Winry, while Alphonse chases after Scar. 
Edward slowly unclasps her hand from the gun saying that her hands were meant to give life and not to kill.
