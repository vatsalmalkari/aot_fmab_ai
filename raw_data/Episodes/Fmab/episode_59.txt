After Mustang agrees to perform a human transmutation, Hawkeye signals him with her eyes and he refuses to proceed. 
Suddenly, May arrives with Jerso, Zampano and Darius who take control while May stops Hawkeye's bleeding. 
At that moment, Bradley (Wrath) appears and picks up the philosopher's stone dropped on the floor. 
However, Pride also arrives and they force Mustang to perform a human transmutation, using the gold-toothed doctor as a sacrifice. 
Mustang passes through the Gate of Truth and appears in Father's lair with Pride and the other sacrifices, finding he has lost his eyesight in exchange. 
While Scar battles Wrath in the chamber above Father's lair, May crashes through the ceiling to find Alphonse unconscious. 
Meanwhile, Alphonse stands before the gate and sees his frail body, despairing that it cannot be used to fight alongside the others. 
Leaving, he promises to return for his body and returns through the gate. 
Regaining consciousness in Father's lair, Alphonse completes the count of five sacrifices for the Homunculus.
