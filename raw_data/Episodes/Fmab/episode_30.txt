Years ago, Mustang's desire to become a state alchemist was disapproved of by his dying teacher, Berthold Hawkeye. 
He asked Mustang to look after his daughter who has the details of his flame alchemy research - tattooed on her back. 
In the present, Edward returns Riza Hawkeye’s gun, explaining his inability to pull the trigger. Marcoh reveals to Scar that after the civil war had continued for seven years, Bradley signed a document approving the extermination of the Ishvalans. 
The killing took an emotional toll on many state alchemists and soldiers, including Hughes and Mustang. 
Marcoh confesses that he was involved in using Ishvalans to make the philosopher's stone, which was given to the heartless state alchemist Major Solf J. Kimblee. 
The Ishvalan leader pleaded with Bradley to end the killing in exchange for his life, but his request was rejected. 
When the civil war finally ended, Mustang resolved to become a new Führer to protect the people, and appointed Hawkeye as his second-in-command. 
Hawkeye tells Edward that when they finally achieve peace, they may be punished for the crimes they committed during the war. 
Meanwhile Envy checks Marcoh's prison cell and finds a beheaded corpse with the word "vengeance" written in blood on the wall.
