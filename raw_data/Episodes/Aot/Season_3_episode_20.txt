While Eren and Mikasa are held in the stockade as punishment for defying Levi in Shiganshina, Eren has a dream experiencing the life of his father Grisha. 
Grisha and Faye were caught outside the Liberio Internment Zone by Eren Kruger and his partner Gross, who secretly has Faye killed. 
Grisha's father teaches Grisha their people's history and the Marley nation's prejudice toward them. 
As an adult, Grisha joins the Eldian Restoration movement. 
The movement is supported by a secret informant in the Marley military named "Owl." 
Grisha marries Dina Fritz, the last Eldian with royal blood on the mainland, and they have a son, Zeke. 
Grisha's attempt to raise Zeke as an infiltrator in the Marley military backfires, as his son becomes loyal enough to turn in his own parents. 
Grisha, Dina, and the Restorationists are taken to the wall of Paradis Island, punished by being turned into mindless Pure Titans once injected with Titan spinal fluid; because Eldians can turn into Titans, Marleyans see them as monsters. 
Dina is revealed to become the Smiling Titan that devours Eren's mother. 
Kruger suddenly kills Gross, revealing himself to be both the Owl and a Titan shifter, transforming and annihilating the Public Safety soldiers.
