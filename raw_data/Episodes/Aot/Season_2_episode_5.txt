In the past, Historia and Ymir became lost in a blizzard during their winter training in the mountains while trying to save fellow cadet Daz. 
Ymir accused Historia of having a death wish rather than saving Daz for selfless reasons. 
She was aware that Historia is the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman's mistress who was forced by the Wall Cult to change her name and join the army to avoid disgrace. 
Ymir made Historia promise that she must live life on her own terms if she ever reveals her true name. 
In the present, Ymir transforms into a small intelligent Titan, fights off the other Titans, and saves everyone. 
Just as the Titans overwhelm her, Hange and the other Scouts arrive in time to save her and the 104th Cadets. 
Before the gravely-injured Ymir loses consciousness, Historia reveals that her real name is Historia Reiss.
