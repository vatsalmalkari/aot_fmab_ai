Hannes reports that the walls were never breached, leaving it up in the air just how the Titans invaded from outside. 
The Scouts prepare to take the comatose Ymir to the Trost District for medical care, knowing she holds valuable information about humanity. 
Just then, Eren learns that Reiner and Bertholdt are the Armored Titan and Colossal Titan respectively, the ones who had attacked his hometown five years ago. 
Their mission is to destroy all of humanity. 
Twelve hours earlier in the Ehrmich District, Hange explained that the background report she'd received on Annie suggested a connection with Reiner and Bertholdt, as all three are from the same area. 
The Scouts realize that the pair may have helped Annie find Eren during the 57th Expedition. 
In the present, Reiner and Bertholdt transform and grab Eren and Ymir. 
Feeling betrayed about who he'd thought were his friends, Eren transforms to fight.
