Eren detaches himself from his Titan's body and climbs out, telling Mikasa and Armin about the basement in his old, destroyed house. His father was working on a secret project there and he believes that it holds the secret to mankind's preservation and destroying the Titans. As the cannons are reloaded for another attack, Eren comes up with two escape plans. The first is for him to flee as a Titan and journey to his old house but criminalize himself, and the second is to have Armin convince Kitts that he is an asset to humanity and the military rather than a danger. Armin decides on the second. However, Kitts is overcome by fear and gives the order to fire. As the trio prepares to defend themselves, the order is halted by Commander Dot Pyxis, as he wants to hear Armin out. Pyxis guarantees their safety in return for Eren's Titan to block the destroyed gate in Wall Rose to prevent more Titans from getting in. Eren agrees to try, regardless of whether or not he will be able to.
