Hange ZoÃ« and her team discover a Titan sealed inside Wall Sina. 
Pastor Nick of the Wall Cult urges them to cover it from sunlight with sheets. 
However, he refuses to tell Hange why it is there, leading her to suspect that there are more Titans hidden within the walls. 
Erwin Smith is informed that Wall Rose was breached by Titans. 
Twelve hours earlier, the rest of the 104th Cadets were stationed at an outpost, unarmed and under suspicion of being Titans, when Titans were seen advancing from the south. 
Miche Zacharius orders them to spread out and inform the nearby villages while he stays behind to delay them. 
Miche is captured by a Beast Titan, which looks apelike and is capable of speaking. 
The Beast Titan takes Miche's omni-directional mobility gear, curious about it, and leaves him to be eaten by the Titans.
