The Colossal Titan vanishes in a burst of steam before Eren can attack. 
The Military Police Regiment scrambles to evacuate the people of the Trost District and set up defenses. 
With the Titans now in the city, Eren recalls his lessons: in order to kill a Titan, they must strike the nape of its neck. 
In the chaos, Eren and Armin's comrades are killed or eaten by the Titans, with Eren himself losing his left leg when he attacks in haste. 
Armin, paralyzed with fear, is picked up by a Bearded Titan. 
Eren manages to pull him out of the Bearded Titan's mouth and reaches for Armin, but the Bearded Titan closes its jaws, severing Eren's left arm and swallowing him.
