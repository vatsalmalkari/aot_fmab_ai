In Ragako, Moblit realizes that the disabled Titan is, in fact, Conny's mother. 
Ymir's past is shown in a flashback; as a child, she was worshipped by a cult. 
The cult was later apprehended and punished by soldiers; each was injected with something, including Ymir, and thrown off the wall, resulting them transforming into Pure Titans. 
Ymir spent the next sixty years as a Titan until she ate Marcel, a childhood friend of Reiner and Bertholdt's, which returned her to human form. 
After accepting her true identity, she met Historia and empathized with her, as Historia's predicament was similar. 
In the present, Ymir convinces Reiner and Bertholdt to allow her to transform and take Historia with them. 
When the Scouts enter the forest, Ymir swallows Historia. 
Reiner transforms and flees with Bertholdt, Eren and Ymir riding on his shoulders. 
However, the Scouts give chase.
