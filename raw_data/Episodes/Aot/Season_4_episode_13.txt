In the forest, Zeke recounts to Levi that four years earlier, on Marley's orders, his spinal fluid was released in a gaseous form on the Ragako villagers on Paradis, where Connie's mother was from. 
It paralyzed them, and then Zeke turned them into Titans with his scream. 
Zeke claims he did it to maintain his cover, but Levi accuses him of not truly caring for the people he killed. 
In the restaurant, Kaya points Nicolo out to Gabi and Falco as the Marleyan who invited them, explaining that he was probably in love with Sasha. 
As the Survey Corps arrive to question him, Nicolo forcefully takes a bottle of Marleyan wine from Connie and Jean.
He brings the wine to the cellar, where Gabi and Falco follow him, revealing themselves as Warrior Candidates. 
Nicolo deduces that Gabi killed Sasha and attempts to bludgeon her with the bottle, but Falco takes the hit, and some of the wine gets in his mouth. 
Nicolo punches Gabi out then carries both back to the dining room. 
He offers Mr. Braus a knife, saying either of them shall kill Gabi. 
The Survey Corps intervenes, and through Mr. Braus, the emotions are calmed. 
Connie and Jean restrain Nicolo, but Mikasa has to save Gabi from a furious Kaya. 
Gabi is escorted to another room by Mikasa and Armin, while Nicolo tells Hange to rinse Falco's mouth as he suspects the wine is tainted with Zeke's spinal fluid. 
He explains that the wine came from Yelena's scout ship, and was to be served to high government officials. 
Meanwhile, Levi receives word of Zachary's death and wonders if he miscalculated Eren's potential as humanity's savior. 
The Jaegerists raid the restaurant and hold everyone at gunpoint. 
Floch demands Zeke's location from Hange and reveals he knew about Zeke's plan with the wine. 
Eren meets with Mikasa, Armin and Gabi and states that he wants to talk.
