As Eren and the Armored Titan battle, the Colossal Titan consumes Ymir and a Scout. 
Hange and the others try to attack but the Colossal Titan releases an enormous amount of steam, scorching and wounding several of them and preventing further attacks. 
The Armored Titan gains the upper hand but Eren uses hand-to-hand combat techniques that he learned from Annie during their recruit training, enabling him to inflict serious damage. 
Eren listens when Armin implores him to fall back to the wall for his own safety. 
As the Armored Titan charges once more, Eren utilizes grappling techniques advised by Hange to overcome his strength disadvantage. 
He is nearly successful at beheading the Armored Titan and extracting the human Reiner from within, only to be foiled when the Armored Titan roars for assistance. 
The Colossal Titan deteriorates and plummets toward them, sure to crush them both.
