In a flashback, Historia tells the Scouts of her upbringing, Kenny's execution of her mother, and her father sending her away after forcing her to adopt a fake identity. 
In the present, Rod explains he did so to protect her from execution. 
Hange tells the Scouts that Eren will be eaten by a Titan of the government's choosing so it can acquire his power to control other Titans. 
Erwin informs Commander Pyxis his plans of a nonviolent coup d'état to overthrow the corrupt Royal Government and restore Historia as the true Queen, as Sannes confessed that the current King is a fraud. 
Erwin reveals that his father was murdered for his theory that the Walls protect the property of the wealthy, not humanity, so they selfishly kill anyone who tries to uncover the Wall's secrets—which now includes Erwin, as he is framed for Reeves' murder. 
The entire Scout Regiment is placed under arrest as part of the plan to dissolve the team. 
Now fugitives, Squad Levi plans the Historia and Eren rescue operation.
