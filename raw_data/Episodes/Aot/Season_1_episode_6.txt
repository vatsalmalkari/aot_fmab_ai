Armin awakens to find himself surrounded by Conny Springer, Historia Reiss and Ymir, blaming himself for Eren's fate. 
An Abnormal Titan approaches the city gate, which is crowded by refugees. 
Mikasa kills it with her atypical, powerful prowess, saving everyone. 
A flashback to the year 844, a year before the fall of Wall Maria, shows that Mikasa's family was targeted by three slave traders, who murdered her parents. 
Grisha and Eren discovered the corpses during a visit and Eren tracked down the slave traders to a nearby hut and killed two of them to save Mikasa. 
The third slave trader began strangling him. 
Encouraged by Eren, Mikasa overcame her fear and gained resolve to kill the slave trader. 
Grisha took Mikasa in, and she now considers the Jaegers family.
