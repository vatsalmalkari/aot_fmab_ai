Edward  Elric, the Fullmetal Alchemist, is the youngest State Alchemist in history, joining the program at the age of 12. 
He and his younger brother, Alphonse, scour the world in search of the Philosopher's Stone, in the hopes of restoring their bodies. 
Edward lost his left leg in a futile attempt to revive his mother, Trisha, using an illegal method of human transmutation, and lost his right arm in exchange for attaching Alphonse's soul to a suit of armor. 
Edward now employs the use of metal prosthetics, known as automail, as replacement limbs. 
However, as attempting to resurrect a human opens a portal called the Gate of Truth to allow the committer/s to see the Truth, Edward gained great knowledge of the universe as well as the powerful ability to perform transmutations without transmutation circles. 
Edward is smart, brave and even bold, but also has a prideful tendency to be harsh and arrogant. 
He harbors a sharp sensitivity to his short height; a recurring gag in both manga and the anime series is for Edward to overly react to people who call him short.
