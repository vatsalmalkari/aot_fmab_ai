Greed the Avaricious, the "Ultimate Shield", is a rogue homunculus who craves money, women, and otherworldly possessions above all else.
Because of this, he betrays the homunculi, as working to feed Father's greed would deprive Greed of his own greedy desires. 
He has the ability to rearrange the carbon atoms that coats his entire body into diamond-hard body armor. 
Greed is introduced when he sends some of his chimera subordinates to capture Alphonse Elric so he can obtain the secret of immortality from him and Edward.
The State Military soon raids their location to rescue Al, where King Bradley repeatedly kills Greed to finally subdue him, taking him back to Father. 
Unwilling to rejoin them, Greed is melted down to his Philosopher's Stone and is consumed by Father.
Later, Lin Yao, in his search for immortality, offers to become the new Greed. 
Greed is given complete control of Lin's body after Lin willingly relinquishes control, believing this to be the only way to gain immortality.
Though this Greed initially has no recollections of his actions as the former Greed, Bido's death brings back the memories of all his loyal subordinates. 
Angry with Bradley for killing his "possessions", and further provoked by Lin, the new Greed defects from the homunculi once more, eventually joining forces with Edward Elric during their fight against Father, intending to take Father's powers and use them for world domination.
However, during the final battle, Greed comes to a realization his true desire is friendship.
To that end, Greed sacrifices himself to aid Edward by transferring himself from Lin's body into a weakened Father, using his abilities to render Father's shell extremely fragile before being extinguished. 
While Father mortally wounds him by snapping his teeth shut, he happily calls Edward and Ling his dearest friends and that he does not need anything else before disintegrating.
