Colonel/Major Roy Mustang, the "Flame Alchemist", is a State Alchemist and Edward's direct superior. 
He is promoted to Brigadier General at the end of the series and is a General in the epilogue. 
He aims towards becoming the next FÃ¼hrer of Amestris, heavily relying on the support of his loyal subordinates to propel him along that path.
Mustang finds this path interrupted by the murder of his best friend and confidant, Maes Hughes; afterward, he begins an almost behind-the-scenes investigation into finding the true culprit.
