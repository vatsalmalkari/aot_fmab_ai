Van Hohenheim is the Elric brothers' estranged father with a keen knowledge of alchemy processes. 
He left them and his wife Trisha several years before the start of the series.
It is later revealed that Hohenheim is several centuries old and knew Father very well. 
Originally a slave from the Kingdom of Xerxes under the designation "Slave Number 23", Hohenheim was used for an experiment by his master, a well known scientist and alchemist, using his blood to create a shadow-like creature known as Homunculus. 
In thanks to his birth, Homunculus gave the slave the name Van Hohenheim and taught him how to read, write, and perform alchemy. 
As the years went on, Hohenheim's status improved and was soon close to the king. 
When Homunculus taught King of Xerxes how to obtain immortality, he instead gave it to Hohenheim and himself, sacrificing the citizens from Xerxes. 
Possessing half of the Cselkcess citizens inside him, Hohenheim escaped in horror and tried communicating with them by the time he entered the land of Xing. 
Having played a role in Xing's development through alkahestry, Hohenheim came to Amestris where he met and married Trisha Elric. 
After discovering that Homunculus (now known as "Father") was going to sacrifice the inhabitants of Amestris, Hohenheim left his family to travel around the country to leave shards from his Philosopher's Stone. 
When confronting Father, Hohenheim's plans succeed as he used the shards to nullify Father's attempt to transmute the people of Amestris.
However, after Father's defeat, Hohenheim dies peacefully in front of Trisha's grave, happy that he was able to meet her and have his sons.
