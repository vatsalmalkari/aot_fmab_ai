A reserved member of 104th Training Corps who graduated 3rd in his class and opened up around Reiner, Bertolt is described as having potential to master every skill he has been taught if he had the motivation for it.
Bertolt is a member of the Warriors and part of Reiner's infiltration team to capture the Founding Titan.
He is also the holder of the Colossus Titan, becoming a skinless 60-meter (200 ft) Titan who can release hot steam to protect himself and repel his opponents.
Bertolt Hoover used his Titan power to instigate the incident of Wall Maria for his group's infiltration and later breach Trost District a few years later to force the Founding Titan's user into the open.
The reason Bertolt joined the Warriors was so his bedridden father could be provided medical care by the Marleyans, carrying a cover story that he came from the same village as Reiner.
Also, Reiner hints that Bertolt has a crush on Annie.
Bertolt is later forced to reveal his true allegiance after Reiner finally breaks and exposes them.
In the battle of Shiganshina, he is captured by Eren and left to be eaten by Armin, who is injected with the Titan serum in order to survive lethal burns.
After Reiner returned to Marley, he learned from his mother that Bertolt's father was content with his son's patriotic devotion to Marley, and peacefully passed away during their mission.
