An overachieving, overconfident, bold and zealous Warrior candidate, Gabi is Reiner Braun's younger maternal cousin, the most outstanding Warrior cadet, and a favorite candidate in line to inherit the Armored Titan from her older cousin. 
In her childhood, she was discriminated and heavily spit on by Marleyans, which made her become bitter and hateful towards the Paradisians, whom she blamed for the persecution of all the mainland Eldians. 
She has a heart of bravery and invincible fearlessness to the extent of throwing bombs directly on the rail of the Mideast Union. 
During the Battle of Liberio after breaking out of prison, Gabi is taken in by Kaya and the Blouse family, beginning to doubt her previous hatred towards the Eldians within the Paradis Walls. 
She later fully renounces her hatred and attempts to stop the Rumbling alongside the Survey Corps and other warriors.
