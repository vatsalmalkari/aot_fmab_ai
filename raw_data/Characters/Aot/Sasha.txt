Sasha is a hunter from the mountainous Dauper District.
She is tall and lean, and her auburn hair is styled in a ponytail.
She is noted as a proficient hunter skilled with a bow and has remarkable hearing and instincts, but she also has issues with structure and authority.
She seems obsessed with food and was nicknamed "Potato Girl" for eating one during a military training drill.
She joins the military after getting into an argument with her father when he tells her they must give up their traditional hunting lifestyle in the forest in favor of farming to support the large number of refugees moving to the area after the fall of Wall Maria.
She manages to become a member of Captain Levi's Elite Squad with a number of her fellow 104th compatriots. 
While withdrawing from Liberio during her group's attack on Marley to acquire both the Warhammer Titan's power and Zeke, Sasha is fatally wounded when shot in the chest by a stowaway Gabi and utters "Meat" with her dying breath.
She is later revealed to have formed a close friendship, implied to be a romantic, with a Marleyan prisoner of war turned chef named Nicolo.
