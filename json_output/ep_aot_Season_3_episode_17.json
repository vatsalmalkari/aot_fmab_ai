  "content": "Erwin is mortally wounded but the Scouts push forward until the Beast Titan wipes them all out. Levi uses this distraction to incapacitate the Beast Titan, ripping out the bearded blond man inside. Levi intends to use the Titan serum to turn one of their own, hopefully Erwin, into a Titan and feed them the Beast Titan so they can gain its power. However, the Cart Titan rescues the blond man. Armin realizes the Colossal Titan goes immobile while emitting steam to defend itself, and comes up with a plan. Hange survived thanks to Moblit's sacrifice, and works with the team to blow Reiner out of his Titan. While Eren's Titan form is seemingly unconscious, Armin challenges the Colossal Titan. Bertholdt burns him alive in his steam, learning too late that Armin used himself as a distraction so Eren had time to harden his Titan form, successfully block the inner gate; then in human form, catch Bertholdt by surprise and rip him out of his Titan.",
