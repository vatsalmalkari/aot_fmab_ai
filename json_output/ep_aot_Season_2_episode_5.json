  "content": "In the past, Historia and Ymir became lost in a blizzard during their winter training in the mountains while trying to save fellow cadet Daz.\nYmir accused Historia of having a death wish rather than saving Daz for selfless reasons.\nShe was aware that Historia is the illegitimate daughter of a nobleman's mistress who was forced by the Wall Cult to change her name and join the army to avoid disgrace.\nYmir made Historia promise that she must live life on her own terms if she ever reveals her true name.\nIn the present, Ymir transforms into a small intelligent Titan, fights off the other Titans, and saves everyone.\nJust as the Titans overwhelm her, Hange and the other Scouts arrive in time to save her and the 104th Cadets.\nBefore the gravely-injured Ymir loses consciousness, Historia reveals that her real name is Historia Reiss.",
