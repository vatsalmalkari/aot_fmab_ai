The Scouts are forced to defend Historia and Eren's wagon, which involves killing human attackers, something they have never done before. Armin is traumatised after killing an actual person rather than a Titan to save Jean. They are forced to retreat when the attackers subdue Historia and Eren with tranquilizer darts and escape. Levi interrogates Reeves, who was coerced into helping the Military Police, and offers him protection in exchange for his help. With Reeves' help, they capture Interior Squad soldiers Djel Sannes and Ralph, who murdered Pastor Nick, and torture them for information. They discover that Historia is the real heir to the throne and is being held by her father, Lord Rod Reiss. Reeves is killed by Kenny for betraying him, witnessed by Reeves' son, Flegel.",
