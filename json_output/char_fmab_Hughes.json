    "content": "Lieutenant Colonel Maes Hughes is an old friend of Roy Mustang. He works in the military's intelligence division but spends much of his time using the military phone lines to brag to Mustang about his family. After his daughter, Elicia, is born, he fawns about how cute and talented she is and bombards others with pictures of her when he sees them. Despite his over-the-top comical tendencies, Hughes is a valuable ally to Mustang's goal of becoming Fuhrer, supplying whatever classified intelligence that may be beneficial. He has also been shown to be a capable fighter, skilled with throwing knives. His general understanding of others' emotions and desire to help them similarly gains the affection of the Elric brothers and their friend Winry Rockbell, as he always offers advice or hospitality to them when they need it. During one of his attempts to help the Elrics, Hughes learns of the homunculi's Nationwide Transmutation Circle plan over the country; in the 2003 anime series, he learns of all the corruption personally plaguing the military for the sake of creating a Philosopher's Stone, with the key suspect, Juliet Douglas, being the final nail in the coffin. However, he is found out and wounded by Lust, forcing him to retreat and call Mustang, only to be confronted by Envy, disguised as Maria Ross. Shapeshifting into Hughes' wife, Gracia, Envy shoots and kills Hughes before he can attack. This leads Mustang to further investigate the truth for himself, in hopes of finding his friend's killer. In the 2003 anime series, he instead investigates the corruption and institution that got Hughes killed in the first place, respecting Hughes' wishes of being a better man and not seeking vengeance.",
