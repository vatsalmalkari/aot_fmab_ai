  "content": "A petite girl who is described as friendly, warm-hearted, and popular to the point where her peers regard her as a goddess.\nHer fellow comrade Ymir and even Reiner are both noted to be very fond of her.\nHer true identity is Historia Reiss, the illegitimate child of Rod Reiss, the true King of Eldia.\nShe lived on a farm owned by the Reiss family within Wall Rose, during which time she only had minimal interaction with her mother.\nMost notably a failed attempt to connect with her ended with her mother wishing that she had the courage to kill her child, and later on when her mother was killed by Rod's elite squad led by Kenny Ackerman, after the fall of Wall Maria, telling Historia that she wished she had never been born.\nBefore Historia herself was killed, Rod Reiss attempted to spare her by ordering she assume the fake name 'Krista Lenz' and live among Wall Maria refugees.\nHistoria later joined the 104th Training Corps, presumably to kill herself due to feeling ashamed of herself and her true identity, where she ranked tenth in her class.\nEventually, Ymir, a fellow comrade realized the \"good girl\" act she put on and made Historia promise to live for herself.\nShe later participated in the defense of Trost in 850.\nWhen Ymir revealed herself as a Titan to save her at Castle Utgard, Historia honored the promise they made prior by revealing and accepting her true identity as heir to the Reiss royal family.\nLater, she and Eren were abducted by Rod Reiss and brought to his cavern where Titan inheritance ceremonies took place.\nAs his only living heir, Reiss attempts to convince Historia to become a Titan and consume Eren to regain the Coordinate power of the Founding Titan.\nHowever, having learned of the Founding Titan's curse of renouncing war due to the 145th King Fritz's shackles, Historia refuses.\nShe rescues Eren and helps the Survey Corps defeat her father after he transforms into a massive Titan, making the killing blow and securing her identity as the true ruler of Eldia.\nHistoria agrees to the Survey Corps' wishes to assume the throne and uses her status as Queen to relinquish most of her ruling duties to the military while using the money confiscated from disowned nobles to improve the lives of orphans and the homeless.\nHistoria later accepts Hizuru's conditions to secure Paradis's safe 50-year long progression into the world stage by agreeing to succeed Zeke Yeager as the Beast Titan and to birth several heirs who would continue protecting Paradis in her stead.",
