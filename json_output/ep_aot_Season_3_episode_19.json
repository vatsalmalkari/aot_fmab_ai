  "content": "Armin wakes up and learns that the nine of them are all that remains of the Scouts.\nHe struggles with Levi's decision to save him instead of Erwin but Levi assures him that he does not regret his choice.\nHange, Levi, Eren and Mikasa finally investigate Eren’s basement.\nGrisha's key is not the key to the door but rather his desk drawer, containing three books.\nOne has an image of Grisha with a woman and child who are neither Carla nor Eren.\nAn inscription explains that the image is called a photograph, created by technology from a wealthy land beyond the Walls.\nErwin had, in fact, always considered that there may be humans beyond the Walls.\nIn a post-credits scene, Grisha's book recounts a time in his youth when he and his sister, Faye Yeager, lived in a city beyond Paradis, the world Eren knows today.\nAgainst their mother's rules, he ran with Faye beyond the walls of their district to watch an airship land.",
