  "content": "At their round-table discussion, Eren claims he is acting on his own free will.\nAs each Titan host is affected by the memories of its previous owner, Eren asserts that Armin is being manipulated into visiting Annie's crystal by Bertholdt's memories.\nEren then reveals that Mikasa, through her Ackermann bloodline, has been programmed to protect Eldia's Kings, but she also accepted Eren as her host.\nHe claims she is no more than a slave, for which he had hated her since childhood.\nEnraged, Armin attacks Eren, although he's first unwillingly stopped by Mikasa.\nEren repeats that it is due to Mikasa's lineage.\nArmin punches Eren in the face, but Eren beats him easily, and insults him.\nEveryone in the restaurant except for Hange is taken to Shiganshina District by the Jaegerists where Eren plans to rejoin Zeke.\nIn the forest, Levi plans to have Zeke eaten by a Jaegerist to prevent Eren from using the Founding Titan.\nZeke runs from the camp and screams, turning Levi's comrades into Pure Titans due to the tainted wine they had drunk.\nLevi kills all the Titans and pursues Zeke, who transforms into the Beast Titan; using Thunder Spears, Levi recaptures Zeke.\nFloch turns the military cadets in Shiganshina to the Jaegerists' side by threatening them with imprisonment, forcing them to beat Commandant Keith Shadis.\nZeke wakes up to find himself lying gravely injured in a cart, with Levi sitting beside him.\nHe's informed by Levi that a Thunder Spear is impaled into his stomach, tied to the detonator around his neck.\nLevi starts chopping Zeke's legs; as Zeke screams in agony, he recalls a memory of his childhood.",
